  personalisationMessage: `Hi Basil,
I understand you’re juggling a lot right now and just need a straightforward, affordable way to get the energy sorted for your new home. We can take care of the whole switch for you – from checking whether you qualify for the Warm Home Discount and any local grant programmes, to finding the cheapest “low‑usage” tariff that matches your dumb‑meter setup. All you’ll need to do is confirm a few basic details, and we’ll handle the paperwork, the meter change (if required) and set up a single online portal where you can view and manage the account for both you and your dependent. If you’d prefer to speak to someone directly, I’m happy to arrange a call at a time that works for you. Let’s get this done quickly so you can focus on what matters most.
