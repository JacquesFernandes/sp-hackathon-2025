  summaryRag: "You can save money on your energy bills by taking advantage of ScottishPower's Power Saver program. Here's how it works: - Once you register for Power Saver, you can automatically enjoy half-price electricity on your unit rate every Saturday and Sunday between 11am and 4pm. ScottishPower will credit your bill to ensure you only pay half-price for electricity used during these \"Half-Price Weekend\" events. - ScottishPower may also offer \"Half-Price Bonus Hours\" events during the week, where they'll notify you to use more electricity during those times to earn credits. - Additionally, ScottishPower may host \"Power Saver Plus\" events where they ask you to use less energy during peak times. You can earn credits by reducing your electricity use during those events. To participate, you need to be a ScottishPower electricity customer with a communicating smart meter and consent to half-hourly meter readings. By shifting some of your electricity use to off-peak times, you can help balance the grid and make the most of renewable energy, while also saving money on your bills.",
